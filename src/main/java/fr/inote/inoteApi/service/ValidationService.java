 * Validation Service
 * A validation records:
 * - username
 * - instant of registration
 * - instant of expiration
 * - associate a random code to this request
 * This object is stored in the database. It ensures that the user has indeed
 * opened the e-mail (and therefore that the e-mail he has given is correct and
 * indeed his property).
 * When the user provides this code, the information sent is compared with the
 * information stored in the validation object, enabling the user to be
 * activated in the application.
 * Nota : Linking logins to e-mail addresses means it's easy for you to find
 * your
 * password, and for sites to contact you.
 * A confirmation code establishes two important facts.
 * -> First, that you haven't accidentally misspelled or mistyped your email
 * address when registering
 * -> Second, that you want to sign up for a site -- you're not being registered
 * there by someone else, perhaps as a prank. Using a code also helps ensure
 * that you're a real person and not a spambot -- a program that signs up to
 * sites in order to spread spam.
