# Launch Inote_RestApi_InDevContext

In a development context, the api is designed to work with a service simulating the smtp server.
The tool used is smtp-dev, whose folder is located in the Inote root folder. The binary (to be run in administrator mode) is Rnwood.Smtp4dev.

The fictitious smtp-dev inbox is accessible in the default browser at the following url:
http://localhost:5000

Note: On linux, you can use the "smtpServer_simul_run.sh" script, located in Inote's root project.
